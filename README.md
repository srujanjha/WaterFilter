# WaterFilter
InternetOfThings Project
In this project we are presenting a low-cost, locally developed customized cloud-based monitoring system for water filters.
 Apart from major functions of monitoring and controlling through a GUI, additional functionalities such as generating reports, keeping logs in historical database are provided through the system. 
 The system has a focus at an institutional level of monitoring water-filters like hospitals, educational institutions, corporate offices etc. 
 The system that has been designed automates the process of monitoring the filters and bringing the human presence only where necessary.
